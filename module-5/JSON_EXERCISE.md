# JSON Exercise

The server's hostname is `TODO`
The server is running on tcp port `80` (standard http port)

## Exercise 1

Make a GET request to the server's `/json` endpoint. Note down the response headers and response
body.

## Exercise 2

Make a GET request to the server's `/number-list` endpoint. Extract the array of numbers from the
response and sum them all up - bonus points if you write a program to do this! Note down the total.
