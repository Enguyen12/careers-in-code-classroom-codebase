# REST Exercises

We are going to use a new api for this exercise, called SWAPI. SWAPI stands for the *S*tar *W*ars
*API* and is an api that can be used to access information ffrom the star wars universe.

Its documentation can be found at https://swapi.co/documentation. This is a pretty hefty document,
and it might seem a bit overwhelming at first. But don't fret! I'd suggest scanning through the
getting started section and then using the side navigation to quickly jump to sections that are
pertinent to the tasks below. Understanding documentation is a big part of what software developers
have to do on a day to day basis and this should hopefully be some good practice.

## Exercises
1. Determine a list of all people in star wars that have a homeworld of `earth`.
2. Determine R2-D2's birth year. Hint: take a look at https://swapi.co/documentation#search
3. How many star wars films does SWAPI have data on?
